      This site was written in <strong>VS Code</strong> using straight <strong>CSS</strong>
      and <strong>HTML</strong>. I'm tinkering with things pretty much constantly.<br />

      I'm currently working on a simple todo tool. You can see it here: <a href="https://tehoatse.github.io/todo.html">https://tehoatse.github.io/todo.html</a>.
      It's all client-side vanilla js. All the data is stored in the browser localstorage. It works for what i need for now and was interesting to make.

      I went to Uni at Monash and learned about everything computing related. I didn't finish the degree but the things I learned the most about were:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Oriented Design</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Java</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relational Database Theory</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Management</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      I'm studying <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a>. It's entertaining and instructional.

      I have an extensive <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> habit. It's
      really handy for modernising my skills and getting exposed to new frameworks and tools.
      They've got a sale on right now and learning things is good so I'll probably buy
      more courses. At the moment I'm doing a <strong>web development bootcamp</strong>
      which has inspired me to make this.

      I'm writing a game called <a href="https://github.com/tehoatse/greyhoundGame">Greyhound</a>.
      It's in <strong>C#</strong> and I intend
      to use <a href="https://www.monogame.net/">Monogame</a> to create an engine for it.
      I'm using <strong>Visual Studio 2019</strong> and I'm planning and upgrade to the new VS in the near future. The idea of the
      game is an animal racing simulator mixed with a science fiction story.

      I live outside the southern Tasmanian town of Bagdad. We own a bit of land
      and we're members of
      <a href="https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/conservation/conservation-on-private-land/private-land-conservation-program/gardens-for-wildlife">Gardens for Wildlife</a>
      and
      <a href="https://tasland.org.au/programs/land-for-wildlife/">Land for Wildlife</a>.
      Wombats live on the same land as us. This is what my back yard looks like:

      When I'm not <strong>making things</strong> or  <strong>learning things</strong> I read
      fiction, play computer games and watch tv. I also listen to <strong>a lot of music</strong>.<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          We're watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2lkvrMa27c">Twin Peaks</a>. I really liked the original series. We saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVNQjThgg3o">prequel movie</a> which was very grim except a few moments, and now we're watching the Return. Can't wait for the Dougie story-line to end.

          I've finished reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viriconium">Viriconium</a> collection and now I've decided to reread the <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/10/future-without-nostalgia">Kefahuchi Tract series</a>. It's for <em>research</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm not really playing any games at the moment. I'll play a little <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RDR2/">RDR2</a> in the evenings.

          I'm trying to listen to Australian music in January. <a href="https://aliennosejob.bandcamp.com/">Alien Nosejob</a> and <a href="https://exek.bandcamp.com/">EXEK</a> are high on my list.
