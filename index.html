      This site was written in <strong>Atom</strong> using straight <strong>CSS</strong>
      and <strong>HTML</strong>. I'm not a fan of Atom, just trying it out to see
      how it goes. Probably any changes will be done in <strong>VSCode</strong>.<br />

      I went to Uni at Monash and learned about everything computing
      related. I didn't finish the degree but the things I learned the most about were:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Oriented Design</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Java</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relational Database Theory</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Management</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      I'm reading my way through Robert Martin's
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>. I'm finding it
      interesting and really handy, especially when I take a break from a project
      then go back and understand what the heck I was doing.

      I have an extensive <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> habit. It's
      really handy for modernising my skills and getting exposed to new frameworks and tools.
      They've got a sale on right now and learning things is good so I'll probably buy
      more courses. At the moment I'm doing a <strong>web development bootcamp</strong>
      which has inspired me to make this.

      I'm writing a game called <a href="https://github.com/tehoatse/greyhoundGame">Greyhound</a>.
      It's in <strong>C#</strong> and I intend
      to use <a href="https://www.monogame.net/">Monogame</a> to create an engine for it.
      I'm using <strong>Visual Studio 2019</strong> and I'm planning and upgrade to the new VS in the near future. The idea of the
      game is an animal racing simulator mixed with a science fiction story.

      I live outside the southern Tasmanian town of Bagdad. We own a bit of land
      and we're members of
      <a href="https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/conservation/conservation-on-private-land/private-land-conservation-program/gardens-for-wildlife">Gardens for Wildlife</a>
      and
      <a href="https://tasland.org.au/programs/land-for-wildlife/">Land for Wildlife</a>.
      Wombats live on the same land as us. This is what my back yard looks like:

      When I'm not <strong>making things</strong> or  <strong>learning things</strong> I read
      fiction, play computer games and watch tv. I also listen to <strong>a lot of music</strong>.<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          We're watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2lkvrMa27c">Twin Peaks</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viriconium">Viriconium</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III">Dark Souls 3</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          I've been listening to <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belong/October+Language">October Language</a> by
          <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Belong">Belong</a> a lot
