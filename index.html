        Projects I've done or am working on right now:
        <ul>
        <li>I've made a simple todo tool, as you do. You can see it here: <a href="https://tehoatse.github.io/todo.html">https://tehoatse.github.io/todo.html</a>.
        It's all client-side vanilla js. All the data is stored in the browser localstorage. It works for what i need for now and was interesting to make.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/tehoatse/atMan">atMan</a> is a toy I've made in Go using the <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea"></a>
            Bubble Tea</a>framework. It draws an '@' symbol to the screen and lets you move it around.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/tehoatse/proprepro">Proprepro</a> is a prose preprocessor that I'm working on to format text for my self-hosted blog and short fiction site <a href="https://obscured.codes/">obscured.codes</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/tehoatse/lordChooser">lordChooser</a> will be an api that will return a random lord for a Total War: Warhammer III Immortal empires game

          <strong>Java</strong>
        </li>
        <li>

      I'm mostly focusing on working with Go at the moment. I'm finding it fun, simple and incredibly powerful.

      I live outside the southern Tasmanian town of Bagdad. We own a bit of land
      and we're members of
      <a href="https://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/conservation/conservation-on-private-land/private-land-conservation-program/gardens-for-wildlife">Gardens for Wildlife</a>
      and
      <a href="https://tasland.org.au/programs/land-for-wildlife/">Land for Wildlife</a>.
      Wombats live on the same land as us. This is what my back yard looks like:

      When I'm not <strong>making things</strong> or <strong>learning things</strong> I read
      fiction, play computer games and watch tv. I also listen to <strong>a lot of music</strong>.<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          We're watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman">BoJack Horseman</a>. It's fun and a bit of a takedown of prestige drama which I'm really enjoying.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the evenings I've been listening to a lot of audio dramas. I recently finished <a href="https://the-magnus-archives.fandom.com/wiki/The_Magnus_Archives_Wikia">The Magnus Archives</a> I'm still not sure how sensible it was to listen to horror stories before sleep.
        </li>

          Right now I'm playing a lot of Total War: Warhammer III lately. I'm a big fan of both Total War and Games Workshop and the properties mesh fantastically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built to Spill released a new album the other week. A new Built to Spill album in 2022 and I'm listening to it <em>right now</em>.
